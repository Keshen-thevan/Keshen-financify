# Budget-App-JavaScript

The project is about building a budget using JavaScript.

The app show the balance, the incom and the expenses totals. It also has a dashboard area where the user can add entries(either an incom or an expense), the user will be able to an income dashboard(shows all income entries), expenses dashboard(shows all the expenses) and an all list(shows all the entries)

The user is also able to edit and delete entries.

All the entries are stored in local storage, so even if the user refreshes the page or closes the page, the data will still be saved.


What I learned: 
- extensive DOM manipulation techniques

- using the local storage to save data

- using the querySelector add and eventListeners to create functions for on click events

- working with the value from inputs and make it more usefull by using complex functions


Challenges:
- one of the challenges i had was actually just outputting the data, the data was getting saved but the output was not working. It was the bug that i struggled with the longest, but the problem was that ( the querySelector was not assigned to the correct IDs and CLASSES )
